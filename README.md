People are consuming content on a wide range of devices these days. It is estimated that by the year 2014 mobile traffic will take over desktop traffic. With this trend your web applications need to be responsive.

In the 1st part of this presentation we are going to look at the ever changing landscape of web design. Where we started out, where we are going and how we go there are important stops on this scenic route. When we fully understand the future we can start to plan for it and thats exactly what we will do here today. 

We are going to take a look at Bootstrap 2.0 which is a tookit that gives you the tools to rapidly develop the front end of your app. This is not only a kit to make pretty buttons with, this will give you the power to developer responsive web applications that can be viewed on a wide range of devices.
