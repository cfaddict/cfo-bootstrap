About This Presentation
=======================================================================

Please come join us Saturday, October 20th, to learn about Bootstrap, from Twitter. Bootstrap is an amazing set of tools to help you kick-start your web applications. It is designed to help people of all skill levels -- designer or developer, huge nerd or early beginner. Use it as a complete kit or use it to start something more complex.

It was originally built with only modern browsers in mind, but it has evolved to include support for all major browsers and, with Bootstrap 2, tablets and smart phones. Despite its small footprint, Bootstrap is one of the most complete front-end toolkits out there with dozens of fully functional components ready to be put to use.

In this presentation, we will talk about the origin of Bootstrap, what it is, and where it may be heading. We will take a deep dive into all of the features of this toolkit.

When you leave this presentation, you should have an understanding of what it does and how to get started. Presenter Dan Vega states: "I feel confident that once you see just how awesome Bootstrap is, you may never start another project without it."
